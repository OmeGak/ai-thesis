This research aims to review unconventional applications of deep learning, focusing on the separation of style and content in images using convolutional neural networks as research is starting to pay attention to this task.
First, in order to have an appropriate context for the discussion, the work will give an introduction to common terms, techniques, and recent breakthroughs in the field of Deep Learning at large and tasks of image recognition in particular.
From then on, it will present how already trained neural networks have been altered and reused for purposes different from what they were initially designed for.
