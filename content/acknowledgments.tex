Firstly, I would like to manifest my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Fernando Berzal for his stellar guidance.
He accepted supervising this thesis in spite of me living abroad and provided me with enough material and inspiration to engage in researching from the very beginning.
He always replied promptly and concisely to my questions and was thorough, honest, and constructive in his criticism, which motivated me greatly to give my 100\%.
Thanks to him, I not only achieved my goals, but I believe I also learned a valuable lesson for my scientific career.
I can only say, without any doubt, it has been for me truly an honor working together.

I must thank my boss Pedro Ferreira at my full-time job for never objecting with accommodating my schedule so that I could spend energy writing this thesis.
Without his understanding and kindness, it would have been impossible to finish in a timely fashion.

I would also like to thank Andrea Santamar√≠a, ever keeping me from feeling \emph{lost} in my journey and making sure I stay well-fed with the food she let me steal from her.
She helped me as well with the trickiest bits of \LaTeX, polishing the introduction chapter, and suggesting ways to organize the bibliography.

Moreover, I extend my acknowledgment to David Medina, finishing his thesis too, for being a restless companion along these months, and to Mohanty Sharada, for his thought-provoking discussions about Deep Learning.

Last but not the least, I am also grateful to my mother, sister, and friends, who supported me throughout the duration of my efforts.
I wish I could have been there for them much more than I managed to.

Some final words of appreciation to a few of the many other little things.
To Undertale, whose story filled me with \emph{determination}.
To Headspace, whose daily teachings reminded me to stay sharp even in moments of stress.
To all the fantastic music that accompanied me during countless hours of solitary writing, which helped me forget about the time passing.
Moreover, to the rainy, rather chilly summer in good old Geneva, without which staying indoors, working on this thesis, would have posed a much more arduous task.
